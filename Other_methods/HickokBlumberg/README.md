Scalar curvature estimation using the method in our paper:

"An Intrinsic Approach to Scalar-Curvature Estimation for Point Clouds" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02615)
A. Hickok and A. J. Blumberg

See tutorial.ipynb for some examples. The data files for the tutorial are stored in the example_data folder. Three of the files ("Rdist_10000.npy", "nbr_matrix_10000.npy", and "T_10000.npy") need to be downloaded from:

and then moved to the example_data folder.
